# REAL_ESTATE_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
The Real Estate Management Database is a MySQL-based project designed to manage and organize information related to properties, agents, clients, and transactions within a real estate business.

It enables users to:
Store and retrieve property details such as type, location, and price.
Manage agent and client records.
Record and track property transactions.
Automatically calculate agent commissions using triggers.
Simplify data viewing through joins, views, and stored procedures.
This project demonstrates the use of core SQL concepts including database creation, relationships (foreign keys), joins, subqueries, triggers, views, stored procedures, and data manipulation commands — providing a complete backend model for a real estate management system.
